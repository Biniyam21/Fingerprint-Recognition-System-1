# Fingerprint-Recognition-System
Matching minutiae (ridge & bifurcation) points using affine invariant transform features.
Steps: Extracting ridge and bifurcation points using Otsu tresholding and morphological operations. Finding convex hulls of the minutiae points. Matching minutiae of fingerprints in database based on the ratio of area of triangles in the convex hulls, because ratio of traingles is an affine invariant feature.
Used Matlab.
